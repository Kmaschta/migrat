# Migrat

*Migrat is a generic Node.js migration tool.* Use it to migrate data in PostgreSQL, MySQL, Cassandra, etc or even regenerate local caches. It's designed for multi-node environments.

It's not as simple to set up as others like [node-migrate](https://www.npmjs.org/package/migrate), but it's designed to be much more robust â€“ capable of handling very diverse stacks and processes.

```sh
$ migrat create add-user-table
# creates migrations/1413963352671-add-user-table.js
$ migrat create add-user-table --all-nodes
# creates migrations/1413963352671-add-user-table.all.js

# show which migrations need to be run:
$ migrat status

# get up to date
$ migrat up
```

### Features

- Reads [NIST] time when creating migrations. Clocks aren't always in sync, especially if working in a VM.
- Supports global locking during migration runs, to prevent multiple servers attempting perform global migrations at the same time.
- Migrations can be set to set to run once globally, or once per server.

## Migration Files

Migration files are pretty standard:

```js
// (required) apply the change
module.exports.up = function(context, callback) { /* ... */ };

// (required) revert the change
module.exports.down = function(context, callback) { /* ... */ };

// (optional) verify the change took place
module.exports.verify = function(context, callback) { /* ... */ };
```

## Configuration

Migrat will look for for a `migrat.config.js` in your project directory, unless overriden by `--config`:

```js
module.exports = {
    // REQUIRED. The folder to store migration scripts in.
    migrationsDir: './migrations',

    // OPTIONAL. Invoked at the beginning of a run, this method
    // should return an object with any details you want passed
    // through to all migrations. This can be database connections,
    // logging interfaces, etc.
    context: function(callback) { /* ... */ },

    // REQUIRED. Where the current migration state specific to the
    // current machine is to be stored. This is only used to for
    // migrations created with the `--all-nodes` flag. Make sure
    // it is writable by the user executing migrat.
    localState: '/var/lib/my_app.migrat',

    // REQUIRED. Persists the current migration state. The `state`
    // argument will always be a variable-length string. Store it
    // to redis, disk, database, ... whatever suits you.
    storeState: function(state, callback) { /* ... */ },

    // REQUIRED. This method is responsible for fetching the
    // current migration state, persisted by `storeState`.
    fetchState: function(callback) { /* ... */ },

    // OPTIONAL. Provide a function that returns a string to use
    // as the source for a new migration file. The `details`
    // argument will be an object containing:
    //   * "filename"  The name of migration file.
    //   * "time"      The Date object used to put the timestamp
    //                 at the beginning of the migration filename.
    migrationTemplate: function(details) {
        fs.readFileSync('path/to/template.js', 'utf8')
    },

    // OPTIONAL. Invoked at the beginning of a migration
    // run. Use this to establish a global lock. You can
    // either wait for a lock to become available, or fail.
    lock: function(callback) { /* ... */ },

    // OPTIONAL. The number of seconds to give up after if
    // a lock cannot be obtained. This is only applicable
    // if the `lock` function is implemented.
    lockTimeout: 0,

    // OPTIONAL. (unless `lock` is implemented). Implement this to
    // release any global lock acquired by the `lock` function.
    unlock: function(callback) { /* ... */ },

    // OPTIONAL. Whether or not to attempt to roll back to the
    // state that existed at the beginning of the run if a migration
    // fails. Note: this only applies to "up" operations (default: true)
    rollbackOnFail: true,

    // OPTIONAL. Callback executed before each migration.
    beforeEach: function(filename, method, callback) { /* ... */ },

    // OPTIONAL. Callback executed after each migration.
    afterEach: function(err, filename, method, callback) { /* ... */ },

    // OPTIONAL. Callback executed right before all
    // queued migrations are executed.
    beforeRun: function(method, to, callback) { /* ... */ },

    // OPTIONAL. Callback executed right before all
    // queued migrations are executed.
    afterRun: function(err, method, to, callback) { /* ... */ }
};
```
